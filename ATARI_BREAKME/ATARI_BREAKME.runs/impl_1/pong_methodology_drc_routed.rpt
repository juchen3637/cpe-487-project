TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.301 ns between batpos_reg[6]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and vga_driver/red_out_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
